    <p>Researchers from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and ShanghaiTech University are learning how to create a robodog that can walk on two legs. This is an exciting glimse of the direction robodogs are heading. 
        If robot dogs were able to walk on 2 legs instead of 4 it would give them more freedom with their movements and allow them to climb more objects.

        <p>Neurotechnology may be used in future workplaces to make workers more efficient and happier. This technology will use Electroencephalography (EEG) that 
        can make sure people are right for the job they are doing. An example of using this technology is analyzing if a person can be a TSA agent and quickly 
        identify a weapon in a suitcase. </p>

            <p>Musk is in the process of asking permission to the US regulators to test the brain implant device. The Neuralink device is around the size of a large coin and contains wires that go
                directly into the brain. Musk says that the main focus for this device is to treat vision and muscle impairments. </p>

                <p>San Francisco has reversed its decision to allow police officers to use robots that are equipped with lethal weapons. If San Francisco went ahead with this decision the police force 
                    would have the authority to kill suspects with robots. Part of this decision comes from the idea that if robots where used to kill it would distance officers from the emotional aspect of killing. 
                The original proposal will now be refined or entirely scrapped.</p>
