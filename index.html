        <p>Neurotechnology may be used in future workplaces to make workers more efficient and happier. This technology will use Electroencephalography (EEG) that 
        can make sure people are right for the job they are doing. An example of using this technology is analyzing if a person can be a TSA agent and quickly 
        identify a weapon in a suitcase. </p>

            <p>Musk is in the process of asking permission to the US regulators to test the brain implant device. The Neuralink device is around the size of a large coin and contains wires that go
                directly into the brain. Musk says that the main focus for this device is to treat vision and muscle impairments. </p>
